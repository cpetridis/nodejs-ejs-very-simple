# Very simple app using nodejs and ejs

# The project
With this app the user can save some usernames, display them and remove a given name with absolutely no use of database. The projects uses just an array to save items.

There is no GUI for this project, just some dynamic html pages written with ejs.

The project runs localhost in port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/users/add-new)

Must have : express framework, ejs, nodemon (for autostart when saving)

# Run
```npm start``` 

# Access the app
http://localhost:3000/users/add-new (add some new usernames)
http://localhost:3000/users/showall (show the names, otherwise it says 'No users')
http://localhost:3000/users/removeuser (remove a username)

Of course the above locations are accessible from the navigation menu on top of the page every time.

# NO CSS, sorry for the awful style
